      Why the aim game?
    </h2>
    <p>Are you an aspiring programmer? Tired of mis-clicking your code and causing infinite loops? Well now there is a game that allows you to perfect your mouse/track pad skills. The aim game!</p>
    <h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>The player must try and click the dot before it moves to another positon on the screen. If you cannot click the dot in time you will get a strike! Three strikes and you are out!</p>
    <p> As the game progresses, the dot will move faster and get smaller. Do your best to get your own personal highscore!</p>
